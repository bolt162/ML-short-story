# Causal Graph Neural Networks in Healthcare

This repository houses the supporting materials for a deep-dive analysis on the application and implications of **Causal Graph Neural Networks (Causal GNNs)** within the healthcare and medical AI sector, specifically referencing a landmark **2025 review**.

The analysis explores how these models move beyond traditional *correlational AI* (such as the well-known **Pneumonia Paradox**) to enable **mechanistic reasoning**, **interventional prediction**, and **counterfactual generation** in high-stakes clinical settings.
